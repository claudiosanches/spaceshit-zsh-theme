# Spaceshit ZSH Theme

A small, fast Oh My Zsh theme inspired by [Spaceship](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/). Spaceship is great, but it checks many runtimes and tools that some setups do not need on every prompt render. `spaceshit` keeps Spaceship's familiar colors and layout, but only includes the most useful pieces for a lightweight experience.

## Features

- **Compact path display**: Rooted at the current Git repository for better context.
- **Git status**: Shows branch and status (added, modified, ahead, etc.) using Oh My Zsh's built-in git helpers.
- **Command duration**: Displays how long the last command took to execute.
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded success/error symbols.
- **Fast**: Minimal overhead by focusing only on essential segments.

## Requirements

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- A [Powerline-compatible font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) (required for the branch and prompt symbols).

## Installation

### Using Git (Recommended)

Clone the repository into your custom Oh My Zsh themes directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/claudiosanches/spaceshit-zsh-theme.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceshit-zsh-theme
```

Then, create a symbolic link (or copy) to make the theme discoverable by Oh My Zsh:

```bash
ln -s $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceshit-zsh-theme/spaceshit.zsh-theme $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceshit.zsh-theme
```

### Manual Installation

You can download the raw theme file directly using `curl`:

```bash
mkdir -p $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claudiosanches/spaceshit-zsh-theme/main/spaceshit.zsh-theme -o $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceshit.zsh-theme
```

### Activation

1. Set `ZSH_THEME="spaceshit"` in your `.zshrc`.
2. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`.
